    <h3 class="y3" >The average person now spends over six hours <br>per day online, a statistic that continues to rise <br> Let’s see where we are spending all that time this<br> year with our list of the 3 most popular websites.</h3>

        <p id="x2">Introducing the 3 most popular websites</p> 
      <div class="y4"> <h1 id="google">Google</h1><section class="y5" > 
        There’s no doubt that Google is the most popular search engine, but this year it remains at the top spot as the most popular website on the internet. Over 40k searches are reported each second on Google – which translates to over 1.2 trillion searches per year! No matter what someone wants to know, Google is the go-to. Not only that, but Google also now serves as the hub for a plethora of other web services including Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Drive and many more.</section>
        
       <h1 id="x3">YouTube</h1> <section id="x5" > 
        <p class="y6"> This website jumped up the list two spots this year as it’s impressive stats continue to climb. Almost 5 billion videos are watched on YouTube every single day. YouTube gets over 30 million visitors per day. Every minute, over 300 minutes of video is uploaded to YouTube. We expect to see YouTube in the top three for a long time to come.</p>
        
        </section>
        <h1 id="amazon">Amazon</h1><section class="y7" >
        Down one spot from last year, Amazon is still one of the top three most popular website on the internet and dominates the online shopping world. From Amazon.com, site visitors can purchase their favorite books, clothing, home goods, groceries and more! And, if they sign up for the Prime membership, those purchases can be delivered to their front door within just a day or two – for free! With such a wide variety of goods and such amazing service, it’s no wonder Amazon is one of the leaders again this year.</section>
