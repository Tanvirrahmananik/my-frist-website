    <h3 class="y3" >The average person now spends over six hours per day online, a statistic that continues to rise. Let’s see where we are spending all that time this year with our list of the 20 most popular websites.</h3>

        <p id="x2">Introducing the 20 most popular websites</p> 
        Google
        There’s no doubt that Google is the most popular search engine, but this year it remains at the top spot as the most popular website on the internet. Over 40k searches are reported each second on Google – which translates to over 1.2 trillion searches per year! No matter what someone wants to know, Google is the go-to. Not only that, but Google also now serves as the hub for a plethora of other web services including Google Docs, Google Calendar, Google Drive and many more.
        
        YouTube
        This website jumped up the list two spots this year as it’s impressive stats continue to climb. Almost 5 billion videos are watched on YouTube every single day. YouTube gets over 30 million visitors per day. Every minute, over 300 minutes of video is uploaded to YouTube. We expect to see YouTube in the top three for a long time to come.
        
        Amazon
        Down one spot from last year, Amazon is still one of the top three most popular website on the internet and dominates the online shopping world. From Amazon.com, site visitors can purchase their favorite books, clothing, home goods, groceries and more! And, if they sign up for the Prime membership, those purchases can be delivered to their front door within just a day or two – for free! With such a wide variety of goods and such amazing service, it’s no wonder Amazon is one of the leaders again this year.
        
        Facebook
        Facebook is the leading social media platform across the world. Its innovative design has changed the way people communicate and live their lives. Every month, the website boasts an impressive 2.37 billion users. 1.66 billion people on average log onto Facebook daily and are considered daily active users (Facebook DAU) as of January 2020, which represents a 9% increase year over year.
        
        Yahoo
        Still going strong is Yahoo.com. Yahoo was the leading search engine and news source for a very long time and still can hold it’s own as one of the most popular websites online. The model has changed a bit however as it really has found more traction for news, articles, finance, etc. vs purely a search engine.
        
        reddit
        reddit.com claims that it is the “Front Page of the Internet.” Created as a site for social sharing and social interaction, reddit.com has become extremely popular among internet users of all age groups and is our single biggest mover since last year, up 11 spots! On reddit users can upload their favorite articles, memes and graphics for the viewing pleasure of other users. Each post is then voted on and ranked by its popularity – with hopes of reaching the front page and gaining views.
        
        Wikipedia
        Wikipedia.org is an online encyclopedia that houses articles on nearly every historical event, location and topic you can think of. Many people turn to Wikipedia for answers to basic questions and beginner research. Wikipedia is building at a rate of over 1.8 edits per second, performed by editors from all over the world. Every day, the site gets over 13.89 million visits, making it one of the most popular websites on the Internet.
        
        eBay
        In 1995, Pierre Omidyar, an online hobbyist, launched AuctionWeb as a section on his personal website. The site’s first successful transaction was a broken laser pointer that sold for $14.83. By 1997, AuctionWeb had changed its name to eBay, and today, the e-commerce corporation has offices in 30 countries. eBay boasts 138 million accounts, and nearly 35 percent of U.S. mobile users have downloaded the company’s app onto their phones. eBay is headquartered in San Jose, California, and claimed over $10 billion in revenue for its last reporting round.
        
        Bing
        Microsoft’s Bing may not be the most used search engine in the world, but it’s climbing the charts. First debuted by Steve Ballmer at the 2009 All Things Digital conference, as of today, Bing is the third most used search engine in the world, behind only Google and China’s Baidu. About 33 percent of Americans fire up Bing for their online searches. Additionally, Yahoo! uses the Bing engine for several platforms and products. The United Kingdom and Taiwan are the company’s second and third largest markets behind the United States.
        
        Netflix
        Eager to emulate Amazon.com’s model, Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph conceived of Netflix in 1997. What started as a mail-order DVD service is now one of the top subscription streaming services on the planet. These days, the platform boasts 148 million users worldwide, with only China, Syria, North Korea, and Crimea denied access. International growth, however, has outpaced domestic gains. Since 2015, the number of new sign-ups outside of the United States has increased fourfold. Stateside account creation, however, has grown at a rate of less than 50 percent. Regardless, Netflix is an online powerhouse that doesn’t show signs of slowing down anytime soon.
